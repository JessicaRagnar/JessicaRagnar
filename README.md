Hi, I'm Jessica Ragnar! ðŸ‘‹  

ðŸ‘€ **Iâ€™m interested in**: Technology, design, and finding clever ways to make digital tools solve real-world problems (or just add a little extra sparkle to everyday life âœ¨).  

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning**: The art of web development â€“ from creating elegant, user-friendly websites to building cool, responsive web apps. I have a diverse background in technology and social sciences. I'm currently enhancing my skills in web development, focusing on creating dynamic and responsive applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python.  

I've also studied digital experience design and digital transformation, gaining insights into user experience, interface development, and sustainable digital strategies. My earlier education in social work has strengthened my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which I combine with my technical expertise to create impactful digital solutions.  

âš¡ **Fun fact**: I've transitioned from a career in social work to IT coordination and now into web development, and I'm excited about combining these experiences to create meaningful digital tools and applications.
